= eBook Toolchain Templates

This is a simple test of various open-source or otherwise freely available toolchains for producing ebooks.

This is by no means a comprehensive survey. Tools that are demonstrated here probably share all of the following qualities:
* open-source or public domain
* source files may be stored in a non-proprietary text format
* entire ebook project is suited to version control (i.e. no reliance on binaries that would need to be merged or regenerated)
